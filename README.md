# Shopping-List

Shopping-List is a project which is developing and has no rigidly requirements set. This is a web application allowing to manage recipes, ingredients and also add the ingredients from the recipe to the shopping list.

The project requirements are growing all the time and new features are adding one by one. Application has very solid backend architecture and it is important to me to keep it solid till the end of the project.

(...) Here will be more details about the project structure later... :)
